# 🌐 About Me

I design decision systems where tradeoffs, risk, and safety matter more than point predictions. With a professional background in autonomous vehicles and robotics, I specialize in prescriptive analytics and reinforcement learning to support executive decision-making in safety-critical and capital-intensive domains.

## 🧠 How I Think

- 🎯 **Decision-First, Model-Second** — analytics exists to improve decisions, not to showcase models  
- ⚖️ **Explicit Tradeoffs & Constraints** — real systems operate under safety, regulatory, and resource limits  
- 🎲 **Uncertainty Is Central** — risk, variance, and tail outcomes matter as much as expected value  
- 🧭 **Governable & Interpretable Systems** — preference for solutions executives can understand, trust, and scale  
- 🚦 **Safety-Critical Mindset** — experience designing analytics where failure carries real-world consequences  

> *My goal is to design analytics and AI systems that improve decision quality while remaining robust, interpretable, and accountable.*

## 🧩 My Work Spans

- 🔢 **Optimization (LP/MIP)** — optimal resource allocation under business rules  
- 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulation** — modeling uncertainty & financial risk  
- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Armed Bandits)** — systems that learn in real time  
- 📊 **Business & Operational Strategy** — translating analytics into managerial action

> *My long-term career trajectory is toward becoming a **hybrid executive** — a leader fluent in business, analytics, and AI — positioned for U.S.-remote roles at the intersection of strategy and technology.*
