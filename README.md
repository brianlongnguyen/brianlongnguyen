# 🌐 About Me

I specialize in analytics and reinforcement learning for decision-making under uncertainty, with a professional background in autonomous vehicles and robotics.  My work focuses on translating advanced analytics--optimization, simulation and RL--into executive-level decisions in safety-critical and capital-intensive domains.

My work spans:

- 🔢 **Optimization (LP/MIP)** — optimal resource allocation under business rules  
- 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulation** — modeling uncertainty & financial risk  
- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Armed Bandits)** — systems that learn in real time  
- 📊 **Business & Operational Strategy** — translating analytics into managerial action  

My long-term career trajectory is toward becoming a **hybrid executive** — a leader fluent in business, analytics, and AI — positioned for U.S.-remote roles at the intersection of strategy and technology.

Reinforcement learning project simulating **3,000+ autonomous vehicle–pedestrian encounters** to determine the safest evasive maneuver (hard brake vs. swerve left vs. swerve right) across multiple speed scenarios.  

An **ε-greedy multi-armed bandit agent** updates Q-values after each trial using a safety-centred reward function that heavily penalizes collisions and perception failures. The learned policy consistently selects **hard braking** as the optimal decision, providing a simulation-based decision framework for AV safety testing.
