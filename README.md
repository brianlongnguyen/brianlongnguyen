# 🌐 About Me

I build analytical and AI-driven systems that help organizations make better decisions — under constraints, uncertainty, and incomplete information.

My work spans:

- 🔢 **Optimization (LP/MIP)** — optimal resource allocation under business rules  
- 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulation** — modeling uncertainty & financial risk  
- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Armed Bandits)** — systems that learn in real time  
- 📊 **Business & Operational Strategy** — translating analytics into managerial action  

My long-term career trajectory is toward becoming a **hybrid executive** — a leader fluent in business, analytics, and AI — positioned for U.S.-remote roles at the intersection of strategy and technology.
